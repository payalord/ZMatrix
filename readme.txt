ZMatrix
=======

ZMatrix is desktop enhancement program.  It attempts to reproduce the streaming
characters shown in the film 'The Matrix' on your computer desktop.  Besides attempting
to reproduce this look, the program also allows you to choose your own color, font,
and background blending methods to suit your taste.  As is implied by the mentioning of
'background blending methods', the program will not necessarily hide your current
background image, rather, it can be told to blend with it in a few different ways
(see the Configuration Dialog).  Furthermore, ZMatrix can also function as a screensaver.

PLEASE SEE THE HELP DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE INFO.

Product Name: Matrix Code Font
Licence Type: Freeware
Platform O/S: Windows/Mac

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Product Information:

This is a true type font which works mainly for windows but I believe
can also work on Mac. These Matrix Code Symbols are a direct code of
the one from the film The Matrix, there are not enough symbols to fill
every charactor like a normal font, and so the operational ones are as
follows:
1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSUTVWXYZabcd

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This product is freeware, feel free to distribute.
